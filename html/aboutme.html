                        My name is Zachary Shelton. I'm a eighteen year old college
                        student, from Bloomfield Iowa, majoring in Interactive Media 
                        Technology. I chose IMT as my major because I love photography
                        and I love designing anything. I don't see myself as creative,
                        but I still enjoy the field I am going into. I used to be a
                        tire technician at my father's shop and originally was going to
                        be in Automotive Technology instead. Last minute I changed my
                        mind which I think is for the best. I see a bright future in
                        this field and I'm glad I made that choice. Currently I work
                        as a server at Applebee's and make great money in tips. I'm
                        good with people and can be very persuasive which definetly
                        helps with my job. In my free time I play video games, go on joyrides, and
                        hangout with friends. I try to be the best version of me
                        that I can be, and that doesn't mean I always do great, but
                        I always put the effort in.

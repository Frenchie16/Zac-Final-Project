            My career plans at the moment are to pursue a job either 
            working as a photographer or a graphic designer. If I were
            to be a photographer, I would like to create my own independant
            business. The reason why is because I enjoy having the freedom
            to choose what work I do and when. Being able to decide whether
            or not I do photoshoots for people, animals, or nature, lets
            me expand my business opportunities. Becoming a graphic designer
            however, I would rather be a corporate designer as I find it more
            more difficult to start and maintain a graphic design business
            compared to a photography business. Working coporate would give
            me stability, but less freedom.

            Life After College

        <p id="life" class="plans">
            Besides my career plans, after college I intend to move to Utah
            for family and the area itself. Utah is a very beautiful state
            that I have been to muliple times, I have family there, and 
            there are many career opportunities there as well. Ogden is the
            city I would like to live in, it's close to Salt Lake City, my 
            family, and large businesses.

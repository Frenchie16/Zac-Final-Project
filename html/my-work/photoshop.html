            These are a just a few of my Adobe Photoshop Projects
            I have done in that last year. The first is an event
            poster I made using the Chromakopia album cover, a
            stock image of a concert, and a recreated logo of the
            album name. The second is a sunset that I took a picture
            of where I edited out the power lines and birds in the
            sky. The last is a project for college where I was
            supposed to make a mythical creature. What I ended
            up doing was making a snail hyrda, editing a snail
            over a background picture I took.
